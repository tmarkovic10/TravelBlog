## General Information
Fullstack social media app that allows users to post images. 
The post consists of different elements such as a title, hashtags, and a description. Users can log into the app by email and password, and if they do not have a profile, it is necessary to create one if they want to use all the functionalities of the app (otherwise it is only possible to view other users' posts). 
Every user can edit and delete their posts or like other user's posts.

This was one of my college assignments and also one of my first projects I created.
